My take on some basic games in Python using PyGame-CE, exploring both fundamental and unusual design patterns.

NOTE: PyGame-CE is the new project to replace the original and now deprecated original PyGame.

Arcade is an alternative to PyGame and they are very similar. Both have matured a lot and are very good game dev platforms.

If you love Python, then the new PyGame-CE and Arcade are incredibly valuable to you.

Gaming platforms can also work well for many real-time applications requiring exceptional GUIs.

PyGame and Arcade are also excellent tools for data scientists and anyone seeking easy access to custom data visualization.

Simulation and unique user input and user-interaction applications are often perfect for gaming platforms and Python just magnifies the potential value in the cases mentioned, because of it's power and flexibility anc capability for extremely rapid prototyping and development all the way to high-perfomrance production deployments.

The PyGame (and Arcade) Python gaming libraries/SDKs are not only for fun 2D games.

I recommend that highly creative developers explore this and don't just jump to 3D or to other languages.

Python is amazing and massively powerful and these gaming libraries have massive untapped-potential and have recently advanced to perform very well on nearly any platform.

Build a 2D version of your app or game in PyGame (or Arcade) and then after that works well, port it to wherever you want to take it.

(I can personally recommend Unity, but I might go for Unreal next but for now I am focusing on Python development.)
