    # This is here for illustrative purposes. This code is not really intended to be imported, but one should still
    # have some kind of appropriate behavior in case the code is imported. It matters where we put a check like this
    # as we could have skipped the initialization by moving this up. In the current program, we do different kinds of
    # initialization inline in the global scope but as the app evolves we might stop doing that and put EVERYTHING
    # inside a class or function. Some might argue that we should have nothing at global scope, but I am usually
    # fine with some things like config and high-level/early initialization at the global scope, but this decreases as
    # an app grows and at some point it might be necessary that even config is passed around as an argument and not
    # referenced globally.
    # In the current location, this simply informs the user that the current code is not meant for import, but it is
    # ok and that the program will not be further started up but rather will exit.
