# For those developing Python on Windows. Now with WSL/Ubuntu live all the time on my Windows 10/11 dev machines,
# I am now just as happy as when using a Mac. Almost no difference. By the way, I heavily use IntelliJ IDEs like PyCharm.
# So, on your Windows, you will want to install WSL:
# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

# I'll add much more info on setting up the ultimate Windows Python/Full-Stack/Open-Source Developers Workstation.
# I'll provide the same for Mac. Docker will be involved for some use-cases. There will be MUCH more info than just
# the WSL link above. I work hard on fine-tuning the ultimate development environments, so you will want to check this
# topic area out independently of this PyGame-CE project.


# Interesting input handling - found via stackexchange:

# IMPORTANT!
# Union type in type hinting solves the problem of allowing None pre-initialization vales and also of allowing
# multiple/different similar types as passed arguments. I will solve both these problems using this.
# There is a compact syntax now we can use which is extremely intuitive. I love it! Go Python! Go MyPy! Go strong typing!

# NOW WE CAN:
# def f(lst: list[int | str], param: int | None) -> float | str:
#     return ''
#
# f([1, 'abc'], None)
