# \b([_A-Z]{5,}?)\b
# cfg.$1
# THE REPLACE WITH THE MEMORY CAPTURE WORKS!!!! Outstanding capability to have inside PyCharm. Saved me a lot of time.


This regex uses sub-pattern memory, quantifiers, word boundaries, greediness and a character class.
I manually confirmed or skipped each replace. There were about 200 matches where was a pretty clean set.
I needed about 60-80 changes made out of those.

It saved me a lot of time and there were zero errors and zero misses.

It was WELL worth crafting this REGEX and discovering that PyCharm search/replace supports all those REGEX features
and does so very well. It has a nice highlight bubble to show you the replacement it proposes (with the
memory-provided pattern there.)

Very nice. PyCharm does continue to get better. All IntelliJ tools are fantastic and worth the money and this has been
the case since at least 2016, I can personally attest to.
