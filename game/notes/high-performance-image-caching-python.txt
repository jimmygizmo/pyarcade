# Python (like LMDB, HDF5, filesystem etc.) I'm considering this topic as I prepare to write an image-loading and
# pre-processing function, so I was thinking what is the best way to store the image data. It will be used
# to instantiate surfaces, which will then be passed into the init of new entity instances. This is to prevent repeated
# unnecessary source-loading of image data and is a core concept to efficiently instantiating sprites.
