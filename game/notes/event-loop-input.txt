    # TODO: Idea for the next little input feature. Make the universe "freeze" by re-starting this main loop right here
    #     when the mouse button is pressed. That will work well with the mouse positioning of the fish. Click-to-freeze.

    # TODO: Next we will disable/remove the above example code for event loop input. Will use pygame.key, pygame.mouse
